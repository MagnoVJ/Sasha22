The idea of this software is to serve as a tool for rendering anything related to what today became common to call computer generated graphics. 
For exemple: 2D and 3D Primitives, Textured 3D Models, Graphs, Lighting, etc...
With every new functionality the hope is that the software becomes more and more powerful serving as a platform for creating all sorts of projects related to computer graphics.

It's being writeen primarly in C/C++ with OpenGL as graphics API.
